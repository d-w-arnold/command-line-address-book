/**
 * The task is to create an Address Book in C or C++ (your choice).
 * You will see the fields we need in the attached spec
 *
 * You have 4 hours to do the task, but this may not be enough time to get everything done
 * to the level you like. So focus on writing good code and making the core functionality
 *
 * Where possible, please avoid using external libraries as we want to see your code,
 * not your ability to integrate libraries. Libraries that come with the language are permitted,
 * for example, using the STL Library in C++ is completely fine
 *
 * When you've finished, could you send me your code and include
 * a README which explains any bugs you know you have,
 * or problems you encountered - we know that bugs happen,
 * especially when you have to make something in just four hours,
 * so we like to see that you are aware of your errors.
 * Also in the README could you say how you would improve your program
 * e.g. if you had 2 weeks on this task, what would you do?
 *
 * When sending me your code there's a small chance my email client
 * will block it because it detects a script (for example) and thinks it is malicious.
 * If this happens, upload your code to a file sharing service like Dropbox and
 * send me the download link instead
 *
 * @return return code
